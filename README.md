# unierp-design-system

**Layer L1 — Foundation** of the [UniERP](../unierp-platform) platform.
Depends on: nothing in the workspace.

## What this is

Tokens → theme → components → charts → data grid → forms → workflow, plus Storybook. Consumed by three frontends and by partner extensions.

## The invariant this repository owns

**No dependency on the API or the database.** That is what makes "a UI component cannot import a service" structural rather than a lint rule. It is one package with subpath exports, not fourteen — publishing fourteen would create 42 version-coherence problems per release.

## The rule that applies everywhere

A repository may depend only on published artifacts of a **strictly lower
layer** — never sideways within a layer, never upward. A cycle is not
discouraged; it is unrepresentable, because the lower layer's package cannot
name the higher one.

See the [platform overview](../unierp-platform/README.md) for the full map, and
[`PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ERPSys/docs/PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md) § 4.2 for
the reasoning.
